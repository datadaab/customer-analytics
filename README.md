Overview

This project conducts a detailed cohort analysis on Business-to-Business (B2B) transaction data, distinct from typical Business-to-Consumer (B2C) data due to unique purchasing patterns and customer behaviors. The primary focus is on evaluating purchase frequency and customer retention. These metrics are instrumental in understanding and improving various critical business aspects.

B2B transactions typically involve larger order volumes, longer sales cycles, and higher customer acquisition costs compared to B2C scenarios. This analysis aims to uncover insights into how often businesses engage in repeat purchases and the retention rate of these customers, which are pivotal for strategic decision-making.
Key Areas Impacted by Purchase Frequency and Customer Retention

    Customer Loyalty: Frequent repeat purchases indicate strong customer loyalty, which is essential for sustained business growth and competitive advantage.

    Retention Rate: By analyzing how many customers return after their initial purchase, we can quantify the retention rate, providing a crucial indicator of customer satisfaction and overall business health.

    Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC): In the B2B context, retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This not only helps in reducing marketing and sales expenses but also enhances overall profitability.

    Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Understanding repeat purchasing patterns allows businesses to predict the lifetime value of their customers, aiding in more informed financial planning and customer service strategies.

    Sales Forecasting: Reliable data on customer retention and purchasing frequency supports accurate sales forecasting, enabling more strategic resource allocation and business planning.
