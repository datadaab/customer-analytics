## Overview

This project conducts a detailed cohort analysis on Business-to-Business (B2B) transaction data, distinguishing it from typical Business-to-Consumer (B2C) data due to unique purchasing patterns and customer behaviors. The primary focus of this analysis is on evaluating purchase frequency and customer retention, which are vital for understanding and enhancing various crucial business aspects.

B2B transactions generally involve larger order volumes, longer sales cycles, and higher customer acquisition costs compared to B2C scenarios. This analysis aims to provide insights into how often businesses engage in repeat purchases and the retention rates of these customers, which are crucial for strategic decision-making.

## Key Areas Impacted by Purchase Frequency and Customer Retention

- **Customer Loyalty**: Frequent repeat purchases indicate strong customer loyalty, essential for sustained business growth and competitive advantage.

- **Retention Rate**: By analyzing how many customers return after their initial purchase, we can quantify the retention rate, a critical indicator of customer satisfaction and overall business health.

- **Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC)**: In the B2B context, retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This not only reduces marketing and sales expenses but also enhances overall profitability.

- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Understanding repeat purchasing patterns helps businesses predict the lifetime value of their customers, aiding in more informed financial planning and customer service strategies.

- **Sales Forecasting**: Reliable data on customer retention and purchasing frequency supports accurate sales forecasting, enabling more strategic resource allocation and business planning.
